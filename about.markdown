I'm a software engineer focused on full-stack web development. 

I have experience building front-end web applications in React and Vue, as well as developing backends using Flask, AWS, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL.

<h3>Fun</h3>

My hobbies include <a href="/design"> drawing</a>, playing video games (especially fighting games!), and <a href="/misc#readinglist">reading</a>.
